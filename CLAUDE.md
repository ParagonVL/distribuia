## Distribuia-Specific Rules

1. **Output must sound native Spanish** — not translated from English, natural phrasing

2. **Always show character count** for X threads (280 limit per tweet)

3. **Watermark on free tier**: "Creado con Distribuia.es" — this is the viral growth mechanism

4. **Never store full video transcripts long-term** — only extracted summaries (cost/storage optimization)

5. **Rate limit API calls** — prevent abuse on free tier

6. **Desktop-first but mobile-optimized** — creators work on desktop primarily
